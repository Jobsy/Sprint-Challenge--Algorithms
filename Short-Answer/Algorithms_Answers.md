#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) 0(n)
It is Linear because it only has one 'while' loop, while the rest are constant

b)0(n^2)
It is Quadratic because it has one 'for' loop, and a nested 'while' loop, while the rest are constant

c)0(n)
It is Linear because it only has one 'recursive' call, while the rest are constant

## Exercise II

Proposed Strategy: Selection Sort

I will be using selection sort because, for every egg that isn't broken represent the current lowest floor. While for every broken egg, that represent a current highest floor compare to the current lowest floor.

The time complexity is 0(n) because it only has one 'for' loop, while the other parameters are constant.
